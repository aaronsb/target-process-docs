# Documentation Graph Visualization

This document describes the 3D visualization tool for exploring the documentation graph structure created by the search indexing system.

## Architecture

The visualization system consists of several components working together:

### 1. Data Extraction Layer

- **Source**: SQLite database (`docs.db`) created by the indexing system
- **Implementation**: Node.js with sqlite/sqlite3 libraries
- **Function**: Extracts document, section, and relationship data from the database and transforms it into a graph structure

The data model follows this structure:
- **Nodes**: Represent documents and sections
- **Links**: Represent relationships between nodes (document-section, section-section, document-document)

### 2. Server Layer

- **Implementation**: Express.js web server
- **Functions**:
  - Serves static files for the visualization interface
  - Provides API endpoints for graph data
  - Handles port management and server lifecycle

### 3. Visualization Layer

- **Implementation**: 3d-force-graph library with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Functions**:
  - Renders the 3D interactive graph
  - Provides filtering and search capabilities
  - Handles user interactions (hover, click, camera controls)

## Technical Approach

### Data Flow

1. The SQLite database is queried for documents, sections, and relationships
2. Data is transformed into a graph structure with nodes and links
3. The Express server provides this data via an API endpoint
4. The frontend fetches the data and renders it using 3d-force-graph
5. User interactions trigger filtering, highlighting, and information display

### Design Decisions

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data extraction, server, and visualization layers
- **Generic Implementation**: No Target Process-specific assumptions, making it reusable for any markdown documentation
- **Asynchronous Processing**: All database operations are async to prevent blocking
- **Graceful Degradation**: Port fallback if the default port is in use
- **Interactive Experience**: Real-time filtering, searching, and node highlighting

### Visualization Design

- **Color Coding**:
  - Documents: Blue nodes
  - Sections: Green nodes
  - Document-Section links: Yellow
  - Section-Section links: Red
  - Document-Document links: Blue

- **Size Differentiation**:
  - Documents: Larger nodes
  - Sections: Smaller nodes

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Hover: Shows node information
  - Click: Centers camera on node
  - Filters: Allow focusing on specific node/link types
  - Search: Finds nodes by name

## Usage

### Running the Visualization

```bash
# Basic usage
./visualize-docs.sh

# Specify a different database file
./visualize-docs.sh --db custom-docs.db

# Specify a different port
./visualize-docs.sh --port 3000

# Combine options
./visualize-docs.sh --db custom-docs.db --port 3000
```

### User Interface

The visualization interface provides several controls:

- **Filter Nodes**: Choose to display all nodes, documents only, or sections only
- **Filter Links**: Choose to display all links, document-section links, section-section links, or document-document links
- **Search**: Find nodes by name
- **Reset Camera**: Return the camera to the default position
- **Toggle Rotation**: Start or stop the automatic rotation

### Interacting with the Graph

- **Rotate**: Click and drag to rotate the graph
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
- **Pan**: Right-click and drag to pan the view
- **Hover**: Hover over a node to see its details and highlight connected nodes
- **Click**: Click on a node to center the camera on it

## Implementation Details

### Files

- `visualize-graph.js`: Main Node.js script that extracts data and serves the visualization
- `visualization/index.html`: Frontend interface for the 3D graph
- `visualize-docs.sh`: Shell script to run the visualization tool

### Dependencies

- **Server-side**:
  - express: Web server
  - sqlite/sqlite3: Database access
  - open: Browser opening
  - yargs: Command-line argument parsing

- **Client-side**:
  - 3d-force-graph: 3D graph visualization

### Database Schema

The visualization works with the following database tables:

- **docs**: Contains document information
  - path: File path
  - title: Document title
  - section_path: Full section path

- **sections**: Contains section information
  - doc_path: Reference to parent document
  - section_id: Unique section identifier
  - title: Section title
  - level: Header level
  - parent_id: Parent section ID
  - section_path: Full section path

- **relationships**: Contains link information
  - source_id: Source node ID
  - target_id: Target node ID
  - relationship_type: Type of relationship (e.g., 'category')

- **keywords**: Contains keyword information
  - id: Unique identifier
  - term: Keyword term
  - category: Category name
  - weight: Importance weight

- **node_keywords**: Maps nodes to keywords
  - node_id: Reference to document or section
  - keyword_id: Reference to keyword
  - count: Occurrence count

- **node_primary_category**: A view that calculates the primary category for each node
  - node_id: Reference to document or section
  - category: Primary category name
  - category_score: Relevance score

### Category-Based Relationships

The visualization creates meaningful relationships between documents and sections based on content categorization:

1. **Document-Section Relationships**: Each document is connected to its sections with bidirectional 'category' relationships.

2. **Category-Based Clustering**: Documents and sections are analyzed for keywords that indicate their primary category (e.g., "User Management", "Integration", "Process Control").

3. **Targeted Connections**: Documents with the same primary category are connected with 'category' relationships, creating clusters of related content.

4. **Cross-Document Relationships**: Documents are connected to relevant sections in other documents that share the same category.

This approach creates a network of relationships that reveals the conceptual structure of the documentation, making it easier to discover related content across different documents.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the visualization tool:

1. **Performance Optimization**: For very large documentation sets
   - Implement level-of-detail rendering
   - Add pagination for data loading
   - Use WebGL for better performance

2. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - Add more node grouping options
   - Implement different layout algorithms
   - Add node clustering for related documents

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Export graph as image or 3D model
   - Save and load graph states
   - Add annotations to nodes
   - Implement path finding between nodes

4. **Integration**:
   - Connect with other documentation tools
   - Add real-time collaboration features
   - Implement version comparison visualization

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Port already in use**: The tool will automatically try the next available port
- **Database not found**: Ensure you've run `./refresh-docs.sh` to create the database
- **Empty visualization**: Check that the database contains documents, sections, and relationships
- **Performance issues**: Reduce the number of displayed nodes using filters
